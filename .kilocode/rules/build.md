# build.md

When you want to build the project, start and stop

## Guidelines

- `./make build` - to build the entire frontend and backend with static frontend assets attached to it.
- `./make start` - to start the backend and frontend in the same process. BEWARE this is a background process. run this in a way what does not block your agentic coding process.

When the project is started you can use `playwright_navigate` from playwright to navigate to the frontend to test what you done.
